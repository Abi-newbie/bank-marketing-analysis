# bank-marketing-analysis
## Project Overview
This project analyzes a marketing campaign dataset from a Portuguese bank to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit ('y' column).
## Contents
- final_script.py: Full Python code for EDA, modeling, trained Random Forest model, and evaluation.
- README.md: Project overview and insights.
- ## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest (final model)
- ## Key Findings
- **Most impactful features**: `duration`, `pdays`, `contact`, `month`
- Clients with past contact success, specifically months those with longer call durations, had higher subscription rates.
- ## Recommendations
- Focus campaigns in months like May, August, and October.
- Target clients with successful past contacts and longer engagement.
- ## How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Install requirements
3. Run final_script.py in any Python environment
